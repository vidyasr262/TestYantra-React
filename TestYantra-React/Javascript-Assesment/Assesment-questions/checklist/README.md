This is a simple to-do list page that has the option to cross off item, remove them from the list,
or to move them to a seperate backlog list. I created it as a simple side project to practice basic
DOM manipulation with vanilla JS. Currently, there are no backend capbilities, so once the page is
refreshed, the entries are all lost.

In order to use this, just open index.html in the top directory. After that, you use the "Add" button
to add an entry (that it takes from a prompt). In the new row, you have then a "Remove" button and a
"Backlog" button that either deletes the entry all together or moves it to a separate backlog list.
Finally, as you go through your day, but before deleting the items, you can cross them off by clicking
the description of the task in each row.
